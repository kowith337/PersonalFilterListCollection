# Welcome to hosts file section!

In here is a collective of hosts file that basically I've created for myself!

Due to some reason that based on few IMHO problems below...

- Some hosts file whitelisted some ads domains for unbreak, however, it doesn't good on privacy to let those domains bypass.
- Sometime I'm lack of finding any hosts file list or domain lists that listed the ads and tracking servers that located in Thai.
- Tried to protect some threads, such as...
  - crapware that once popular in Thailand (overpromoted in the past at some TV programs that talk about technology)
  - scam shopping sites that use big brand name to capture credit card data.
  - Bad clickbait sites in Thailand that trying to use for discredit purpose (mostly political POV), spread and/or shoutout with social account bots to attract users to click or view their sites, also their sites are fully loaded of ads, tracking and maybe inject mailicious codes to takeover/control your device as botnets.
- I want to use Facebook on the mobile browser and data as normal or same behavior like I'm using over generic connections (in-home use network such as broadband, fiber optic, etc.), proxy and/or VPN.
  - Unfortunately, when I'm use on mobile data, Facebook try to redirect away, and then landing to the subdomains that prepared for mobile data users, so I decide to block it all because it's possible to leak some data (mainly about cookies and session data) to mobile operator itself that maybe easy to read without needed any tools to decrypt!
    - And seems like Facebook try to forcefully make users to subscribe their `Free Basics` plan, in order to allow you enjoying to use Facebook and related services for free (however, the large size {means about data} images and videos wouldn't load), while keep tracking your information and data all the time...

I have no guaranteed about any breakage to use or setup with my lists below, however, you're still free to share your opinion, suggestions and improvements in the issues dashboard.
