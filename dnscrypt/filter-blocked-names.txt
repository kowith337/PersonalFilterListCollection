# ZuckBook tracking prevention
# Note: I've added this due to I'm always NOT USING ANY FACEBOOK APPS, however, certain apps and website are added Zuck's assets
#       and Zuck use the SDK and embedded connections across websites to tracking you everywhere and everything, this is a great
#       punishments agains it!
# Hint: If you're still addicted to use ZuckBook, consider to use within browser that support DoH and use any resolvers to bypass
#       blocking, for Firefox you may need to set `network.trr.mode` to 3 because it will strictly use DoH for resolve domains
#       instead of use both generic and DoH together that may result of ZuckBook domains still blocked.
