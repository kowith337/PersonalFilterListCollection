# ZuckBook tracking prevention
# Note: I've added this due to I'm always NOT USING ANY ZUCKBOOK APPS, the only way I use ZuckBook is via browser only, however,
#       Zuck start to ban wrapper apps and raise false alarm to users who use those apps will be treated as unauthorised access,
#       then you will get forced to open in their bloated official app or plain browser (no matter about desktop or mobile) for
#       review all activities that you've done via wrapper apps, you will be oriented to delete those activities regardless of
#       you exactly did it all of them!
# Also: Certain apps and website are added Zuck's assets and/or SDK that have lots of connections to ZuckBook across websites to
#       tracking you everywhere and everything just for determine interests of users for show targeted ads and zuckestions based
#       on user actions and sites that users visited whenever users came back to ZuckBook, this is a great punishments agains it!
# Hint: If you're still addicted to use ZuckBook, consider to use within browser that support DoH and use any resolvers to bypass
#       blocking, for Firefox-based you may need to set `network.trr.mode` to 3 because it will strictly use DoH for resolve
#       domains instead of use both generic and DoH together that may result of ZuckBook domains still blocked, while Chrome and
#       Chromium will prioritize DoH if these domains below are blocked locally!!
