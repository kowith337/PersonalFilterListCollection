### I will...
- Aim to support preventing internal ads, tracking, phone home, **zuckestions**, etc.
  - Disclaimer\: *I'm not guarantee for desktop version about removing in-feed ad posts!*
- Keep away from any attempts that **zuckest** to installing `unfriendly for your privacy` [official apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Facebook).
- Keep away from any attempts that **zuckest** to use and/or register for related products. (Instagram for good example!)
- Keep away from any attempts that **zuckest** to follow their related products of Facebook, include related peoples under its company.
- Make something easier and clearly (e.g. managing adverts preferences)
- Remove unnecessary things that rarely need (e.g. Fun facts)
- Also (currently mainly) support mobile site version, both...
  - [Basic feature phone](https://mbasic.facebook.com) or
  - [Smart phone](https://touch.facebook.com) (likely official app layout, except some random tabs like Marketplace, Videos, etc.)

### I will not...
- Support all of **beta** subdomains!
- Support anything that related to `Free Basics`, `internet.org` and others like.
  - Instead, I will prevent connections to those related services due to it's really broke the internet, even Facebook itself.
    - For example, if you trying to open `mbasic.facebook.com` for access the minimal version of Facebook mobile site (aka. Feature phone mode), you will get redirect to `h.facebook.com` **without HTTPS connections**, then redirect you back to `mobile.facebook.com` and may force to use the cripped smart phone layout like visiting `m.facebook.com` or `touch.facebook.com`.
	  > depend on what your browser's user agent that you are...

Please note, due to I have no tolerance against `Free Basics` (aka. `internet.org`) services, somehow you're still got prevented to use Facebook on mobile browser or over mobile data as properly way like regular networks (e.g. home network, workplace or Wi-Fi)

Note about Combination of Facebook lists that support for Zero users (aka. who use `Free Basics`)
> I cannot predict how long I will keep that thing and I may not touch those related domains anymore if one of two conditions below are met!
> - My tolerance of using Facebook under those unwanted subdomains are out of limit!
> - `Free Basics` were gone out of the current internet world forever!!
