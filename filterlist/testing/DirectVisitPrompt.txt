! Description: This list is good to use if you're using alternative instance viewer frequently instead of directly visiting to
!              mainstream services and/or use browser extensions for redirect to privacy-friendly instances, maybe you're too
!              paranoid and not trusting to view on main websites because of ads, tracking, profiling, fingerprinting, etc...
!              Like ASTLW, the `document` rule blocking will be halt the connections until you press temporary/permanent allow,
!              I create this because `LibRedirect` isn't officially upload their extension on `Chrome Store` yet, but I've found
!              that even I've sideload extensions and later it was unloaded itself after another session, then cause the
!              redirection failed unfortunately!
!              All document blocking rules will based on...
!              - Privacy Redirect (Multi-browsers Extension, currently deprecated): https://github.com/SimonBrazell/privacy-redirect
!              - LibRedirect (Firefox Extension): https://github.com/libredirect/libredirect

! Note: My opinion prefer instead of `LibReddit` because of lightweight and less eye-candy, e.g. colorise, material design, etc.

! [Pixiv]

! Google Maps: 
! Google Search: We knew that they've added shady parameters, such as `ei`, `ved`, `usg`, etc. to keep track all sessions,
!                but completely blocking isn't good at all for many users, however, you might try tweak browser settings to
!                search on  another sites instead, my priority of search engine is...
!                - `SearX`: I go to Neocities first for randomise, even though some instance are often show no results
!                           becaus of blocked by relay, e.g. `Google` mostly block by recaptcha antibot.
!                - `DuckDuckGo`: Because of `improving` tracking, so I should step down to later choice...
!                - `Google` should be the last as possible!
! Google Translate: Even we have SimplyTranslate, but it didn't have function to translate website!
