!   upgrade favourite's games and community badge (obviously, need to expose interactions on the platform!?), trading items,
!   whatever that not touch the games that already bought and just play them, leveling up profile for me is meaningless, even
!   it's seems to be cool to have something special on appearance, but is it really improve somethign in real life at the end?

! * WARNING: This function will completely break (Probably) entire sites due to `DynamicStore` is the core function of Steam
!            store page, especially for store frontpage that show various deals, recommendations, zuckestions, etc. However,
!            this is the only way to dealing against shady `app_impressions` cookies, so I have no other solutions than this yet!
!            Ensure that you only navigate to the proper games that you want to buy or save each game page that you've planned
!            to checkout and then put into the cart one by one until you've got all of games that you really want to.
!            This scriptlet will be inactive by wrapping into this condition, to enable this manually, just copy rules below
!            and then paste into "My rules" manually!!

! - Prohibit Steam website to detect touch screen from first touch, however, **this cause major site features malfunction!**
!   * Note that it may require to delete `strResponsiveViewPrefs` cookie first to make this script injection work properly, if
!     you've forgot to do that before, maybe the `cookie-remover` scriptlet rules above will handle it!
!   * This will helpful in case if you don't want to let `Steam` showing responsive header and menu bar, but you still want to
!     browse that website as proper desktop site, while use touch screen function as for mouse click and page scrolling.

! Thanks for the SimpleWall and neither ContextMenu Firewall apps that appear in Tweaking Software or EasyContextMenu, I've also
! block some shady steam EXEs that not necessary for my life anymore, include SteamServices, SteamWebHelper, SteamErrorReporter,
! etc. plus those EXEs are ruined my precious notebook performance too much like a potato chips! even I just run only the main
! steam client!! I give no thanks for new UI and FUCK THOSE EXPERIMENTAL LABS THAT MOSTLY DO TRACKING US FOR JUST OFFER PRECIOUS
! TARGETED AND IMPACT ZUCKESTIONS, AND WE CANNOT OPT OUT FROM THEM FOR SURE!!!
! Now I've giving up and launch steam client without activating any browsers modules from it, anything that I need to do while
! playing games will ended to browsers (and sometime mobile app) only, include subscribe and managing workshop contents.
! Even I've also use android app that linked to personal account, but I will only use for workshop related functions, not for
! looking to other games and/or software through its apps anymore, unless I've open in the browsers that can install uBlock0!!!!
