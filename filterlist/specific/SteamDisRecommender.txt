!   upgrade favourite's games and community badge (obviously, need to expose interactions on the platform!?), trading items,
!   whatever that not touch the games that already bought and just play them, leveling up profile for me is meaningless, even
!   it's seems to be cool to have something special on appearance, but is it really improve somethign in real life at the end?

! block some shady steam EXEs that not necessary for my life anymore, include SteamServices, SteamWebHelper, SteamErrorReporter,
! etc. plus those EXEs are ruined my precious notebook performance too much like a potato chips! even I just run only the main
! steam client!! I give no thanks for new UI and FUCK THOSE EXPERIMENTAL LABS THAT MOSTLY DO TRACKING US FOR JUST OFFER PRECIOUS
! TARGETED AND IMPACT ZUCKESTIONS, AND WE CANNOT OPT OUT FROM THEM FOR SURE!!!
! Now I've giving up and launch steam client without activating any browsers modules from it, anything that I need to do while
! playing games will ended to browsers (and sometime mobile app) only, include subscribe and managing workshop contents.
! Even I've also use android app that linked to personal account, but I will only use for workshop related functions, not for
! looking to other games and/or software through its apps anymore, unless I've open in the browsers that can install uBlock0!!!!
