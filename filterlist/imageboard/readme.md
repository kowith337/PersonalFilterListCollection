# Freezing State Notice:

The `Gelbooru` site owner and their team decided to lockdown themselve by limited viewing some tags and images for registered users only, I cannot predict that their owners team will easily know that you're still using content blocker, and probably in the worst case senario, they will be disable or terminate your accounts and/or blocking IP address for prevent attempts to revisit their site while you're still activating privacy protection tools, either hosts files, content blockers, custom stylesheet, custom scripts, etc.

As for your safe state and if your privacy is matter enough, try looking to other similar services that not aggressively violate your privacy just for their profits like that site itself!

### GelboLube is a filterlist that target to use on Gelbooru, an image board site that have safe and not safe images.

This aim to redesign cripped layouts and eliminate every ads on `Gelbooru` without allowing any ads, even it's served or generated from site itself.

But this list was designed to use with **uBlock Origin** only, I strongly **not support AdBlockPlus**.

> *You know why.*

Also I'm not responsible of any broken function on that site if you use this list and combined with **EasyList** or **Fanboy List** because it's messed some functionality (like hide search bar, page number, or something else that matter to use.)

> Unless you've found my filterlist was broke some function and surely it's this filterlist false, if you're not sure, you can check the logger and report back to me via [issue dashboard](https://github.com/kowith337/PersonalFilterListCollection/issues/labels/Site%3A%20Gelbooru).

I recommended to use other lists, such as Hosts File, AdGuard or any lists that really understand your privacy.

> meaning it's not allow third party resources to load for unbreak, such as allow ads script from `ExoClick` to prevent **[Plan B](https://github.com/kowith337/GelboLube/wiki/Blocking-rule-explanation#ublock-resource-injection-rule)** method to serve ads.
