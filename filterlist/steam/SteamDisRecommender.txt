!   whatever that not touch the games we've already bought and just play them, leveling up profile for me is meaningless, even
!   it's seems to be cool to have something special on appearance, but is it really improve somethign in real life at the end?

!   * Note: The main use of blocking broadcast is prevent partners/developers/creators annoyance from that function that distract
!           your away before buying or viewing game details, include keep showing mini-popup video streams while scrolling down,
!           hints that this game have deals and/or sales ongoing, etc. however, viewing live broadcasts on the community hub and/

! - Prevent them read and return your interactions data for nearly-perfect disable recommendations!
!   * Later as of 2022/05/07, I've found that if I've allow `dynamicstore/userdata` XHR even just when not logged in, Steam will
!     set default value that  allowing `app_impressions` cookies to be set for certain pages via response data, e.g. viewing news
!     events and announcements, regardless of injecting and/or override script values, so completely blocking those requests will
!     fully get rid of that cookies, just for now until they've changed some script codes again, plus they even not know your
!     data enough via that request to throw any zuckestions, but they will already know from another ways, however...

! Scriptlets Injection  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - !
! These cookies are not necessary, except it use for tracking purpose!
! Detailed notes from Steam cookie settings: `app_impressions` and `browserid`
! - Our own internal analytics that we use to determine traffic to a specific store page and reported anonymously.
!   app_impressions lasts only for one page view.
! In my opinion:
! - They've binded both `app_impressions` and `browserid` together for switch between accept/reject, however, I cannot guarantee
!   that removing `browserid` cookies will be potentially not keep your login sessions or not, however, `app_impressions` are
!   still fine to removed, even though they've claimed that its cookie will last between page navigations, but I will keep use
!   scriptlet functions to remove that cookie everytime to make sure that `Steam` will not gain benefits for keep tracking users
!   by reading and/or storing more values of `app_impressions` cookie between navigations!
! - Even you've set to reject their cookies, however, it's seems like `Steam` doesn't respect user settings that we don't want
!   its `app_impressions` cookies layed in browser, if you possible to subscribe "Anti-impression DLC" list, consider to use it
!   after reject their cookies!

! I don't even know that they also track impressions in community hub too! However, community hub site may not aggressively set
! `app_impressions` cookie like store domain once `g_bAllowAppImpressions` value set to false, but I'm not sure that if they
! have any leftover script functions to keep tracking and storing shady cookie or not?
! At least for currently, these scriptlet injections to override its value will not break community hub entirely, that's mean its
! safe to put in base list.
steamcommunity.com##+js(set, g_bAllowAppImpressions, false)
steamcommunity.com##+js(set, g_SNR, null)

! This probably related to `home_scroll` cookie, remove this script to prevent creating/modifying scroll tracking cookie!
steampowered.com##+js(addEventListener-defuser, $J, GetNavCookie)

! - Prohibit Steam website to detect touch screen from first tap, however, **this cause major site features malfunction!**
!   - Note that it may require to delete `strResponsiveViewPrefs` cookie first to make this script injection work properly,
!     if you've forgot to do that before, maybe the `cookie-remover` scriptlet rules above will handle it!
!   - This will helpful in case if you don't want to let `Steam` showing responsive header and menu bar, but you still want to
!     browsing as proper desktop site, while use your touchscreen control only for mouse click (tap) and page scrolling (flick).
!   - In some case if you want to use touch mode, just resize browser window width lower than 2:5 ratio is enough!

! Thanks for the SimpleWall and neither ContextMenu Firewall apps that appear in Tweaking Software or EasyContextMenu, I've also
! block some shady steam EXEs that not necessary for my life anymore, include SteamServices, SteamWebHelper, SteamErrorReporter,
! etc. plus those EXEs are ruined my precious notebook performance too much like a potato chips, even I just run only the main
! steam client!
! I give no thanks for new UI that eat performance just for showing friends who customised their profile with
! (MP4/WebM) backgrounds in mini card, animated avatar and frames and such, also FUCK THOSE EXPERIMENTAL LABS THAT MOSTLY DO
! TRACKING US FOR JUST OFFER PRECIOUS TARGETED AND IMPACT ZUCKESTIONS, AND WE CANNOT OPT OUT FROM THEM FOR SURE!!
! Now I've giving up to use their new UI and always launch steam client without activating any browsers modules from it!!!
! Anything that I need to do while playing games will ended to browsers (and sometime mobile app) only, include subscribe and
! managing workshop contents, of course, I will not run both for anytime, it's depend on what things to focus.
! Even I've also use android app that linked to personal account, I will use only for workshop related functions, not for looking
! to view (and buy)? other games and/or software through its apps anymore, unless I've open in the browsers that can install uB0!
