### I'll aim to...
- Strips tracking parameters and any unwanted binding (e.g. `s(e|n)r`, `curator_^`)
- Prevent micro trailers to be loaded, this will aim to save browser performance!
- Resist to load profile decorations that use animated avatars, videos and frames from points shop!
- Stop auto-detect touchscreen and force apply immersive layouts, this will suitable for users who have touchscreen monitor.
  - Unless you've resized browsers below `2:5` ratio scale or you're an actual mobile\/tablet users
- Prevent tracking cookies to be created and/or modified and delete if it have any before, especially **`app_impressions`**
- Try to revert profile viewing mechanics that show only thin frame with indicator colours about online status and\/or playing game.
- Prevent live broadcasts from developers or games to be show in store page that their use for promote its game or introduce something new to users!
- Remove pane to sugeest interact with empty contents (e.g. write reviews, post artwork or screenshots into the games hub that just {plan to be} release)
- Hide, prevent and remove sugeestions and recommendations based on platform tracking (e.g. deals{partial}, for you, friends, marketing promo, play time, queue, similar, etc.)
