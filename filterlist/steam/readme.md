# I'll try to remove distraction and user-tracking feature of Steam website!

### I'll aim to...
- Strips tracking parameters and any unwanted binding (e.g. `s(e|n)r`, `curator_^`)
  - Also automatically strip `os` query by default to ignore sticking to PC (Windows) platform all the time while searching for products.
- Prevent micro trailers to be loaded, this will aim to save browser performance and data consumptions!
- Resist to load profile decorations that use animated avatars, videos and frames from points shop!
- Stop auto-detect touchscreen and force apply its layouts, this will suitable for users who have touchscreen monitor but don't want to use an immersive interface all the time!
  - Unless you've resized browsers below `2:5` ratio scale or you're an actual mobile\/tablet users
- Prevent tracking cookies to be created and/or modified and delete if it have any before, especially **`app_impressions`**
- Try to revert profile viewing mechanics that show only thin frame with indicator colours about online status and\/or playing game.
- Prevent live broadcasts from developers or games to be show in store page that their use for promote its game or introduce something new to users!
- Remove pane to sugeest interact with empty contents (e.g. write reviews, post artwork or screenshots into the games hub that just {plan to be} release)
- Reveal certain informations of filtered games but still left slightly dimmed instead of completely hide almost all informations!
- Hide, prevent and remove zuckestions and recommendations based on platform tracking (e.g. deals{partial}, for you, friends, marketing promo, play time, queue, similar, etc.)
- Punishment the overpromoted **`Replay`**, both of profile widget, section and features!

and many more...

### Regarding to certain users...
If you're using any kind of extensions or user scripts that helping about purchasing games with discounts or deals and found this filters blocked (necessary?) connections about `dynamicstore/userdata`, I'll not responsible about this and will be ignored due to I don't think it's good to let other peoples know your information about how many games you've bought, even creator about those kind of extenstions claim that it won't use or hand the copy any informations from you for other purpose, also I don't think it's good to allow those connections to retrieve information and use it to show zuckestions for individual users, either!
