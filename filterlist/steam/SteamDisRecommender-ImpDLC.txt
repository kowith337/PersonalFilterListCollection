! WARNING: These function below will completely break and maybe make the site "DEAD" entirely because certain script functions
!          are mostly relying to `appid`, but its value are came from impression tracking function, plus `snr` tracking values!
!          However, this is the only way to dealing against shady `app_impressions` cookies, so I have no other solutions than
!          this yet!
!
