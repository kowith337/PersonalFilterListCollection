! Descriptions: This is a DLC list of "Steam Dis-recommender Filters" that will not bundle into the base list, unless you want an
!               extreme privacy to prevent junkful impression tracking cookie and not mind about breaking steam websites, neither
!               store or community!

! WARNING:
!   These function below will completely break and maybe make the site "DEAD" entirely because certain script functions are
!   mostly relying to `appid`, but its value are came from impression tracking function plus `snr` tracking values!
!   However, this is the only way to dealing against shady `app_impressions` cookies, so I have no other solutions than this yet!
!   Even some users can turn off its cookie via cookie settings page, but using the function to creating and modifying cookies
!   whenever any games appear in browser screen is disgusting and it's a proof of bad privacy of steam itself since they can use
!   that function to observe and record user activities by default!!
!
! Limitations:
! - I cannot prevent that cookie being created/modified if you've browse game lists from "Steam curators" with their comments
!   and recommendations, so avoid browsing any games through that features until you've rejected all cookies first!
!   * See "Best advice" instruction
!
! Known breaking after prevent impressions tracking for some possibile way:
! [Store]
! - Front page that show various deals, recommendations, zuckestions in horizontal paging/scrolling, include seasonal sales.*
! - All of handbill-size of game images in front page won't load. (especially in slideshow pane)
! - Sometime it's probably break preview videos.
! - You may not narrow or filtering reviews.
! * Noted that I've tried with IceCat and Iceweasel and found site breaking are less than Chromium-based for a few, only tested
!   on 2021 mystery summer sales during.
!
! Best advice:
! - If you subscribe both of my Steam lists separately, please temporary unsubscribe this (anti-impression) filterlist first
!   before log in.
! - Or else if you don't want to break website by my list, please login with redirect to Cookie settings or go to cookie settings
!   page early, then press the "reject all" button, once you've rejected all cookie, all of nasty cookies are probably never
!   build up.
!   * I cannot confirm if some functional cookies may keep tracking you or not
!   - Cookie settings page: https://store.steampowered.com/account/cookiepreferences
!   - Login link with redirect to cookie settings: https://store.steampowered.com/login?redir=account%2Fcookiepreferences%2F&redir_ssl=1
! - Note that it will only affect to `SteamPowered` domain only, it may not respect settings when you're at `SteamCommunity`
! - The UTM cookie will not set to reject even you've press the "Reject all" button, please scroll to the bottom page to set it!
! - Ensure that you only navigate to the game browsing lists or proper specific games that you want to buy or save each game page
! that you've planned to checkout and then put into the cart one by one until you've got all of games that you really want to...
