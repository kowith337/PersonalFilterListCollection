! Descriptions: This is a DLC list of "Steam Dis-recommender Filters" that will not bundle into the base list, unless you want an
!               extreme privacy to prevent junkful impression tracking cookie and not mind about breaking steam websites, neither
!               store or community!

! WARNING:
!   These function below will completely break and maybe make the site "DEAD" entirely, especially during "Sales Events" because
!   certain script functions are mostly relying to `appid`, but its value are came from impression tracking function plus `snr`
!   tracking values!
!   However, this is the only way to dealing against shady `app_impressions` cookies, even you've tell to `Steam` that you don't
!   want all tracked cookies, it doesn't help you get rid against it, `Steam` still using the function to creating and modifying
!   cookies whenever any games appear in browser screen, I think it's too disgusting and it's a proof of bad privacy of `Steam`
!   itself since they can use that function to observe and record user activities by default!
!
! Limitations:
! - I cannot prevent that cookie being created/modified if you've browse game lists from "Steam curators" with their comments
!   and recommendations, so avoid browsing any games through that features until you've rejected all cookies first!
!   * See "Best advice" instruction
!
! Known breaking after prevent impressions tracking for some possibile way:
! [Store]
! - Front page that show various deals, recommendations, zuckestions in horizontal paging/scrolling, include seasonal sales.*
! - All of handbill-size of game images in front page won't load. (especially in slideshow pane)
! - Sometime it's probably break preview videos.
! - You may not narrow or filtering reviews.
! * Noted that I've tried with IceCat and Iceweasel and found site breaking are less than Chromium-based for a few, only tested
!   on 2021 mystery summer sales during.
!
! Best advice:
! - If you subscribe both of my Steam lists separately, please temporary unsubscribe this (anti-impression) filterlist first
!   before log in, once you've done, you can re-enable this list again.
!   - Cookie settings page: https://store.steampowered.com/account/cookiepreferences
!   - Login link with redirect to cookie settings: https://store.steampowered.com/login?redir=account%2Fcookiepreferences%2F&redir_ssl=1
! - Note that it will only affect to `SteamPowered` domain only, it may not respect settings when you're at `SteamCommunity`
! - The UTM cookie will not set to reject even you've press the "Reject all" button, please scroll to the bottom page to set it!
! - Ensure that you only navigate to the game browsing lists or proper specific games that you want to buy or save each game page
!   that you've planned to checkout and then put into the cart one by one until you've got all of games that you really want to.

! [Fix and hide broken carousel and preview pane]
! Those elements already broken by scriptlet rules above since their carousel items require to load JavaScript functions that
! bind with functions to track users (by `snr` and observe visibility of other games, then written in `app_impressions` cookie),
! but instead of completely hide them, I will remove all of carousel panes and leave only some header text and buttons for
! allowing you to manually navigate to specific category directly.

! [CSS Override]
! - Right pane preview are broken by same reasons above, expand the game list to cover against removed pane instead.

! [Requests Blocking]
! I'll move the "EventComponents" functions to here instead of staying in the base list, because it's potentially break seasonal
! sales events page (NewYear {also Chinese}, Summer, Spring, Winter, Halloween, etc.), however, the function for browsing games
! and also zuckest for you to buy based on tracking via games you've already own, games that appeared in browser screen still
! break by this filterlist function that prevent tracking cookie, so complete block event functions is probably good after all.

! - Aggressively prevent using of "Broadcast" functions in store site!
!   * This potentially break possibility of viewing update news and events from various games!
