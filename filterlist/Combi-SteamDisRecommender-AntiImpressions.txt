! Changed method to handling and preventing `app_impressions` tracking (with "cookie" write)
! * WARNING: This function will completely break and maybe make the site "DEAD" entirely due to `DynamicStore` is the core
!            function of Steam store page, especially for storefront that show various deals, recommendations, zuckestions, etc.
!            However, this is the only way to dealing against shady `app_impressions` cookies, so I have no other solutions than
!            this yet!
!            Ensure that you only navigate to the game browsing lists or proper specific games that you want to buy or save each
!            game page that you've planned to checkout and then put into the cart one by one until you've got all of games that
!            you really want to.
