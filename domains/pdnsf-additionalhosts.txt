# Blocking connection check mean "Google Play" cannot trigger app updates and/or downloads unless you've once allow it!
# However, it's may prevent some unexpected behaviour, such as update disabled system apps without intent, e.g.
# YouTube, Google Chrome, Google Play Store itself, etc. and especially Google Play Service, because every update will reset
# device admin state, e.g. "Find my device"
# (even you've turned off already, but it will re-enable after update it or reboot! and it's no way for disable permanently!!)*
# * Unless your device was rooted, updated to Android 10 (Q) or use another OS ROM that not ship with any G-APPS!!!
# Also, I don't want to use Chrome and YouTube, but unfortunately, I cannot find any proper way to keep stop updating it without
# that method!
# Futhurmore, because "Android 6+" can force use Google Chrome as System WebView, it's likely impossible for disabling that!
# Unless you're...
# - Uninstall "Chrome" as first user level via ADB (`adb shell pm uninstall --user 0 com.android.chrome`)
#   * Note that I cannot guarantee that `Play Store` will reinstall Chrome without user intent or not, like it's still happen
#     with Google Play AR Core (`com.google.ar.core`)
# - Install any apps that able to duplicate your apps with work profile (e.g. Insular, Island, Shelter) then "Freeze" Chrome in
#   those kind of app and also "DON'T EVEN UNFREEZE AND/OR USE IT!"
# Once you've done that, Android will pick default System WebView and you will unable to use Chrome as WebView anymore because
# Android will think that not all profiles are enabled Chrome for ready to use as WebView!
#connectivitycheck.android.com
#connectivitycheck.gstatic.com

# Even you've allowed connectivity check above, "Google Play Store" use `gvt1` domains for updating apps, but they also use
# randomized subdomains for phoning home (contains "beacon" in hostname) during, you may need to whitelist it manually, however,
# I prefer you to looking for "Aurora" or "Yalp" and whitelist those apps instead if you don't want to use their official store
# app for update anything about applications in your phone!
# Futhurmore, `Youtube` also commonly use 'redirector' subdomain to redirect ad videos as well.
# - Note that some apps are check "Installation source" that it's actually come from "Play Store" or not, you may lost some
#   feature or you can't even use app if it's detected that you're not installed from desired source that they want!
#   * Reminder: I've commented it instead of whitelisting, in other words, rest of other `gvt` servers that not `gvt1` should be
#               blocked entirely due to it's mostly use for attempt to `beacon` back to home servers...

# Google Play subscriptions

# Google MESSages desktop sync/access (App preview messages)

# - At mobile device side, it have many attemps to ping this domain, even you didn't use above feature.
# - This connections will not neccessary if you're using another default SMS apps.
# * Make sure you've disable "App Preview Messages" first before re-enable rules or temporary disable blocking in pDNSF app,
#   otherwise, you cannot change state of that feature.
# ** Also possibly break RCS chat messaging that require your phone numbers and mobile operator info in order to use this
#    feature, however, it's still safe to block if you didn't intent to use RCS and bloated `Google` default messaging app!

# Facebook Zero Substances (aka. "Free Basics", wait, no! "Free BaZUCKS")
# Allow these connections below means they can use additional tricks for keep track you with old tech, such WAP and MSISDN!
# It's very clear before login on the mobile browsers + cellular data that `Facebook` will obtain some data from "HTTP header"
#   at the beginning! plus, their system can easily to determine that it's really you because the SHAME quality of WAP protocol!!
# Some HTTP header data (aka. MSISDN) are ship with your mobile phone numbers and can be leak to ANYONE who want to capture it!!!
# - Obviously! How many bad reputations, news and shoutouts about privacy while using `Facebook` right now!?
# - If you've previously pair your phone numbers with your account, well, RIP your privacy, I cannot do anothing more...
# - From above, it's become easy to use (very limitation without images and videos) `Facebook` and MESSenger for free under
#   "Free BaSucks", oops! "Free Basics" if you do, then good luck out there and again, RIP your privacy and phone numbers, too!!
#   > Expected telesales who retrieve your numbers by anyway that they can will mass spam call to your numbers more and more!?
# - Some shady companies in my country are also use those method above to resolve phone numbers via those headers and protocol
#   for silently subscribe garbage contents and/or simply charging additional costs in billing or deduct prepaid calling balance,
#   with or without anything sending right to your mobile phone! (by SMS, MMS, WAP Push, etc.)
# Even their Free Basics domains was blocked, they can still tracking you from the main and sub hosts with that methods as well!
# Note: They will binding your "DATR" cookie with mobile carrier name that you're using and also store it for 2-3 days or maybe
#       longer, even you've already avoid using `Facebook` on mobile data during, you should check with diagnostics page at
#       `https://m.facebook.com/diagnostics` and see if they show "Recent carriers (DATR)" name and still remembered it or not!?

# I knew it's will break anything that rely to `Facebook`, such as MESSenger, Login with, Play (instant) games, Comments, etc.
#   But in other words, make use of third party login button and/or plugins are mean allow its platform to tracking you easily
#   regardless about you've previously logged in to their service or not!
# -  For more safety, Don't use in-app browser! `Facebook` know you are logged in if you enter any websites that put plugins
#    and/or tracking code on that sites, in other words, you can blame site owner who have done that too!!
# -  However, since `Facebook` improved ability to track users by make use of "fbclid" parameter, even you've use another
#    browsers to open links from `Facebook`, you may better use something to strip them out! e.g.
